# Implementation of paper "BKCA, an E-Consultancy System for Studying"

This project implements the **key-phrase extraction** method in paper [BKCA, an E-Consultancy System for Studying](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/309958272_BKCA_an_E-Consultancy_System_for_Studying)

## Abstract
To automatically predict key phrases from the input question, both supervised and unsupervised approaches were used. Key words were firstly automatically extracted using naive Bayes classification and then an unsupervised approach for combining key words into key phrases. In the training corpus for the naive Bayes classification model, key phrases were semi-automatically selected by expert opinions.
